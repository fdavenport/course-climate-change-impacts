## CIVE 480A6 - Climate Change Risks and Impacts in Civil and Environmental Engineering (Colorado State University)

This repository contains code and data examples used in CIVE 480A6, offered at Colorado State University as an experimental course in Fall 2024. 

The objectives of this course are to introduce students to common types of climate data, including historical observations and climate model simulations. We also go over how to analyze data to understand patterns of climate change.

Python notebooks and examples shown in class can be found in the **lectures** folder.
