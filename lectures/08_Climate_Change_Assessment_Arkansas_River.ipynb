According to the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-stream-temperature), \"higher temperatures reduce levels of dissolved oxygen in the water, which can negatively affect the growth and productivity of aquatic life. Persistently warmer temperatures in streams can accelerate natural chemical reactions and release excess nutrients into the water.\"\n",

If there is a risk of hotter stream temperatures in the future, river restoration efforts might be able to help adapt to these changes by adding vegetation that can shade the river, adding deeper pools where water stays cooler, or by increasing the dissolved oxygen in the stream. Additionally, river recreation policies could be updated to limit fishing on hot days when fish are already stressed."
